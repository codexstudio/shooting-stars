SHIT TO DO MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!

-- Movement --
    - Input Handler - Add to Philips interface -> virtual joystick capabilities

-- Base Character Class --
    - Define Bounding boxes and hit detection
    - Define all AI in Base class since all our actor classes utilize it? (other option is make a seperate AI class for sub characters to inherit from. i.e. multiple inheritance)

        - Inheriting Classes -
            - Player Character class (Player Ship)
                - Has a "switch" in behaviour : Either is using AI from base class to wander or is receiving player input.
            - Non AI Enemy class (Asteroids)
            - AI Enemy class (Enemy Ships)

-- UI --
    - Score
    - Pause Button

-- Enhancing object pool interface --
    - Create pools for all character types
    - Create methods for pulling and resetting objects to and from the pool

-- Main Game Logic --
    - Set and scroll game background here?
    - Set spawning rates
    - Control game speed
